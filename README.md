## Software Developer at HCA

- 🏢 Employer: HCA ITG
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him They/Them

I work on in-house Web Applications that serve as an Internal Tooling suite for HCA Integrations.
These applications handle anything from Integration workflow requests to modifying, deploying, and monitoring interfaces in one of the world's largest instances of Cloverleaf.

I primarily work in Vue.js front ends with Node.js backends, but I also dabble in our team's large scale applications in Elixir.


I take interest in Machine Learning and Neural Nets, and love to play with making baby parsers/interpreters.

⚡ Fun fact: I make beer and mead in my spare time, and practice Historical European Martial Arts
